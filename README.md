# Abimis Webkit

Abimis Webkit is a collection of components and code used by the Aterrae Team to craft beautiful responsive websites and great web experiences. This kit provides a basic styling to most of the tags that you will be using in your project and has growing customizability and a solid Grid System.

### Getting Started

You can download and use the Abimis Webkit by cloning the repository using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aterrae/abimis-webkit.git
```
Or you can install it as a bower component
```bash
bower install abimis-webkit
```
And you can even install it using Yarn! (yeah, you can also use the NPM installer but Yarn is cooler üê±)
```bash
yarn add abimis-webkit
or
npm install abimis-webkit
```

When using as a component you'll have to create a **Settings** file in your scss cloning the file contained in the source of the webkit, this is in order to overwrite the variable values that are preset in the Abimis Webkit original file.

### How to use it

You can learn how to use the Abimis Webkit components by going to the [Abimis Docs Website](https://abimis.aterrae.com), you can also use it offline by consulting the docs folder in the project.
